# Creating icons
------------------

If you want to contribute by creating new icons, this can easily be done on any computer.

1. Install Inkscape
2. Add the color palette to inkscape
3. (optional) Add the templates to inkscape

## Installation

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install inkscape
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install inkscape
```

## Color palette
Download the Nord color palette  here </br>
And/or the Nord modified color palette that contains some additional colors here

To add the color palette to Inkscape, move the .gpl file to ` $HOME/.config/inkscape/palette/ `. 
> note: If inkscape was open, restart it for the changes to take effect

Finally, in Inkscape, switch to the Nord/Nord modified color palette. More informations on how to change the color palette in Inkscape are [here](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/palette.html).
## Templates
As a starting point for applications icons, here are some templates.
After downloading them, you can add them in Inkscape by moving the templates to `$HOME/.config/inkscape/templates/ `
